===========

This project/repository is my introduction to the DataSciences/GitHub World...so Hello World!!
I'm a Christian and an electrical engineer from Ga Tech living in Greenville, SC and working for Windstream Communications. I need everything I do to glorify and please the LORD. I intend that my experiences with Data Science and GitHub to do just that. Consequently, it is vastly important to me that I become excellent in this because I believe it honors, glorifies and pleases GOD for us to do our very best, in HIS name, with the opportunities and talents HE gives us. I believe He rewards our efforts to please HIM by giving us health and other needed resources to glorify and please HIM even more.
